# HTML & CSS TEMPLATE
This project is a HTML and CSS template that I built by following along with a tutorial on YouTube. Through this project, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and how to use them to create a simple, responsive website. I also learned how to use Google Fonts and some basic tips and tricks with pseudo elements in CSS3. Overall, this project helped me to understand the foundations of web development and gave me the confidence to continue learning and building more complex projects
